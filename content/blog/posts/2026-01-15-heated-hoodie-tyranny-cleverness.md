*(or: how technology keeps solving problems we didn't have, while inventing new ones we do)*

I bought a heated hoodie. Not a jet engine. Not a nuclear reactor. A hoodie. The kind of garment whose historical job description has been remarkably stable for several centuries: *keep the human vaguely warm while looking mildly dishevelled*.

And yet, within minutes, the thing stopped working.

Not because it was broken. Oh no. That would have been honest. It stopped because the **power bank decided nothing was happening**.

This is modern technology in its purest form: a system so clever it concludes that reality itself is mistaken.

#### When warmth becomes suspicious

The hoodie warms up nicely for about sixty seconds, then goes cold. The power bank, having performed a brief audit of the universe, shuts itself down. Why? Because the hoodie does not *look* like a phone.

Phones, apparently, are the moral centre of the electrical universe. Anything else - especially something as unfashionable as *heat* - is treated with deep suspicion.

The hoodie draws a small, steady current. Sensible. Civilised. Thermodynamically literate.
The power bank, meanwhile, is hunting for dramatic spikes of activity - a sort of dopamine-driven attention economy for electrons.

No spike? No scrolling? No frantic signalling?
Then clearly nothing of value is occurring.

#### The manual's finest moment: "warm prompt"

Now let us pause to admire the manual.

It suggests pressing a button to issue a **"warm prompt."**

This is a phrase of breathtaking ambition.

A hoodie, historically, does not require *prompting*. It is not a shy intern. You put it on, and it warms you. That was the contract.

But here we are, borrowing language from behavioural psychology and AI interfaces to describe what is, in essence, **asking a jumper to please do its job**.

"Warm prompt" implies:

- The hoodie might be *reluctant*
- The hoodie might need *encouragement*
- The hoodie might be *context-aware*

This is not clothing. This is a poorly managed middle manager.

#### Automation that mistrusts humans

What's really happening here is familiar.
Someone, somewhere, optimised for the wrong outcome.

The power bank is not designed to deliver energy. It is designed to **avoid liability**. To shut down. To protect itself from imagined misuse. To assume the user is an idiot unless proven otherwise - and even then, only briefly.

So the human adapts:

- Pressing buttons periodically to reassure the machine
- Adding fake electrical loads to trick it
- Carrying extra cables like ritual offerings

This is not progress. This is **cargo cult engineering**.

#### The crime: mistaking intelligence for value

The heated hoodie commits the cardinal sin of modern tech: it assumes intelligence is inherently useful.

But warmth does not need intelligence.
Warmth needs **reliability**.

The most successful heating technologies in history include:

- Fire
- Wool
- Sitting closer to other people

None of these require firmware updates.

#### The punchline

The hoodie works perfectly when plugged into a wall socket.
In other words, when connected to **stupid power**.

The moment you introduce a "smart" intermediary, it fails - not randomly, but *confidently*. It fails because it believes it knows better than you whether you are cold.

Which is, in many ways, the defining problem of contemporary technology.

We are no longer warm.
But the system is very pleased with itself.
